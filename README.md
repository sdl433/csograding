# csograding  
This project is supposed to be an automated grader for C programming assignments, without the use of Gradescope.    
It will take in a submission written in C as a parameter, generate a random sample of test cases, and compare its output
to the expected.  
  
As of now, I intend on writing the bulk of the code in Java and use JNI to execute a C program from the JRE. However, this  
may change to using purely C.
